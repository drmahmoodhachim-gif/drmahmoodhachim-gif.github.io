========================================

Use the RNA-seq pipeline tutorial to analyze gene expression in leukemia samples.
Your synthetic data simulates: Control vs Treatment (e.g., healthy vs leukemic blasts).

When you run the pipeline, interpret your DEGs in the context of:
- Hematopoietic differentiation genes
- Leukemia drivers (e.g., fusion genes, mutations)
- Cell cycle, apoptosis in blood cancer
