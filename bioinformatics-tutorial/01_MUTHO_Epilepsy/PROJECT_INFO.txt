========================================

Use the RNA-seq pipeline tutorial to analyze gene expression in epilepsy-related samples.
Your synthetic data simulates: Control vs Treatment (e.g., seizure vs non-seizure conditions).

When you run the pipeline, interpret your DEGs in the context of:
- Ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors
- Synaptic plasticity genes
- Epileptogenesis pathways

→ Read START_HERE.txt in main folder, then double-click RUN_ANALYSIS.bat
