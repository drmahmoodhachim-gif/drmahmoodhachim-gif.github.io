STUDENT: ZEHRA
PROJECT: Breast Cancer - Fibroblasts
========================================

Use the RNA-seq pipeline tutorial to analyze gene expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts.
Your synthetic data simulates: Control vs Treatment (e.g., normal fibroblasts vs CAFs).

When you run the pipeline, interpret your DEGs in the context of:
- Cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) markers
- Extracellular matrix remodeling
- Tumor microenvironment, stroma-tumor crosstalk
