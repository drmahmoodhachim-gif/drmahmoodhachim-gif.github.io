PROJECT: Cardiac Genetics (Congenital)
========================================

Use the RNA-seq pipeline tutorial to analyze gene expression in congenital cardiac conditions.
Your synthetic data simulates: Control vs Treatment (e.g., healthy vs congenital heart defect).

When you run the pipeline, interpret your DEGs in the context of:
- Cardiomyocyte development genes
- Congenital heart disease genes (NKX2-5, TBX5, GATA4)
- Cardiac morphogenesis pathways
