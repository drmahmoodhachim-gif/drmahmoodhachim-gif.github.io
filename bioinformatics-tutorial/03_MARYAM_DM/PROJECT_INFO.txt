Use the RNA-seq pipeline tutorial to analyze gene expression in diabetes-related samples.
Your synthetic data simulates: Control vs Treatment (e.g., healthy vs diabetic/islet dysfunction).

When you run the pipeline, interpret your DEGs in the context of:
- Insulin signaling, glucose metabolism
- Beta-cell function and survival
- Inflammatory pathways in diabetes

→ Read START_HERE.txt in main folder, then double-click RUN_ANALYSIS.bat
