PROJECT: Autoimmune Asthma
========================================

Use the RNA-seq pipeline tutorial to analyze gene expression in autoimmune asthma.
Your synthetic data simulates: Control vs Treatment (e.g., healthy airway vs asthmatic/inflamed).

When you run the pipeline, interpret your DEGs in the context of:
- Th2/Th17 immune responses, eosinophils
- Airway remodeling, smooth muscle
- Allergic inflammation, IgE pathways
