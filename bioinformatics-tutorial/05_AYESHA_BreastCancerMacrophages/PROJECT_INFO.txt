PROJECT: Breast Cancer - Macrophages
========================================

Use the RNA-seq pipeline tutorial to analyze gene expression in tumor-associated macrophages.
Your synthetic data simulates: Control vs Treatment (e.g., naive macrophages vs TAMs).

When you run the pipeline, interpret your DEGs in the context of:
- Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), M1/M2 polarization
- Immune evasion, immunosuppression
- Phagocytosis, cytokine signaling
